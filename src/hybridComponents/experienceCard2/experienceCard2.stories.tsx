A major focus was on enhancing the efficiency of the template generation process by eliminating redundant tasks and streamlining workflowsâ€”this led to a 50% reduction in generation time and significantly improved developer productivity.</p>
    <p>Collaborating closely with backend teams, I contributed to several features using the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern, ensuring cohesive changes across both frontend and backend systems. I implemented automated email campaigns for key user scenarios such as abandoned carts, abandoned searches, booking confirmations, and promotional engagement, improving user retention and partner engagement.</p>
    <p>To support these campaigns, I wrote complex queries to extract data from Hadoop tables and utilized internal tools like Cusco Llama and Campaign Manager (Kafka-based template engine) to create and deliver customized emails. I also worked with PME (Partner Mail Engine) and Iterable for marketing automation, and developed responsive email templates using the FreeMarker templating language.</p>
    <p>Technologies: React.js, TypeScript, Kotlin, Scala, SQL.</p>
